Exploration 1 
  I build a Express web server, but it’s seems like the homepage stay in “Express” and that’s not what I want, I want to display a favorite song. But I don’t know where to store my web pages. So I tried to search on the Internet,and I know that I can set a file content to place my static web pages, and access them easily using URL.

Exploration 2
  I want to make an animation of a ball falling down and rebounding for several times until it lost energy to bounce.
